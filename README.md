# Advent of Code 2025
All days solved in C#.

Run with:
```sh
./aoc [test or not] [day]
```
The `test` option before the day will use the test input instead of the real day input. If you just provide the day number it will try to use the real input (which is not included).

The repository structure is as follows:
```
root
|-/days (The solutions for each day)
|-/inputs (Place real inputs named DayXX.txt here)
|-/tests (Included test inputs)
|-Program.cs (Main program for running AoC)
|-aoc (Simple runner Bash script)
|-adventofcode2025.csproj (Build configuration)
|-.gitignore (I ignored all binaries, the .sln and junk)
|-README.md (This)
```

Additionally, I want to thank [HyperNeutrino](https://www.youtube.com/@hyper-neutrino) for her in-depth videos, which I referenced from days 9 onward, as well as [this video](https://youtu.be/xibCHVRF6oI?si=9FHzwLb9Uioijbxy&t=1009) by [icub3d](www.youtube.com/@icub3d) for the Day 10 Part 2 solution, which would otherwise be leagues beyond my understanding.

Merry Christmas and see you next year.
